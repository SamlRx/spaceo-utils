# Description

This project is an OpenSCAD repository to create useful 3D models for Spaceo Box.

There is a high chance those files could be used for other projects as well, so feel free to use them.

# Usage
To use the models, you can clone the repository and open the `.scad` files in OpenSCAD. You can then render the models and export them in various formats as needed.
